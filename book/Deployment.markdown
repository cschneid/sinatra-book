Deployment
==========

Heroku
------

This is the easiest configuration + deployment option.  [Heroku] has full
support for Sinatra applications.   Deploying to Heroku is simply a matter of
pushing to a remote git repository.

Steps to deploy to Heroku:

* Create an [account](http://heroku.com/signup) if you don't have one
* `gem install heroku`
* Make a config.ru in the root-directory
* Create the app on heroku
* Push to it

1. Here is an example config.ru file that does two things.  First, it requires
   your main app file, whatever it's called. In the example, it will look for
   `myapp.rb`.  Second, run your application.  If you're subclassing, use the
   subclass's name, otherwise use Sinatra::Application.

        require "myapp"

        run Sinatra::Application

2. Create the app and push to it

       From the root-directory of the application

       $ heroku create <app-name>  # This will add heroku as a remote
       $ git push heroku master
