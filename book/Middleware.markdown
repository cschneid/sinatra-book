Middleware
==========

Sinatra rides on [Rack][rack], a minimal standard interface for Ruby web
frameworks. One of Rack’s most interesting capabilities for application
developers is support for "middleware" -- components that sit between the
server and your application monitoring and/or manipulating the HTTP
request/response to provide various types of common functionality.

Sinatra makes building Rack middleware pipelines a cinch via a top-level `use` method:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'my_custom_middleware'

use Rack::Lint
use MyCustomMiddleware

get '/hello' do
  'Hello World'
end
```

## Rack HTTP Basic Authentication

The semantics of "use" are identical to those defined for the
[Rack::Builder][rack_builder] DSL (most frequently used from rackup files). For
example, the use  method accepts multiple/variable args as well as blocks:

```ruby
use Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|
  username == 'admin' && password == 'secret'
end
```

Rack is distributed with a variety of standard middleware for logging,
debugging, URL routing, authentication, and session handling. Sinatra uses many
of of these components automatically based on configuration so you typically
don’t have to use them explicitly.
