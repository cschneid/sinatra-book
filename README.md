Sinatra Book
============

A cookbook full of excellent tutorials and recipes for developing Sinatra web applications.

How to build the Book
---------------------

Before you can translate the book into various formats you need to install the dependencies.

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

In the root directory, launch the following Rake task:

    bundle exec rake book:build

This will build a PDF version of the book in the output folder

You can run the built-in book sinatra app to view it in your browser too:

    rackup

Then visit: http://localhost:9292/
